### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a self-taught Junior Full stack developer from Argentina. There is always something new to learn, so that's why I am passionate about programming.

ðŸ’ª My main stack is React.js, Node.js and MySQL.
ðŸŒ± But now I'm working with the entire ecosystem of React (Redux, Gatsby) and other great stuff like GraphQL.
ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything you want, maybe there's something we can do together.
